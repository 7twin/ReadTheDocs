Hue Bridge Lights
=================

To import the lights from your genuine Phillips Hue bridge, first open ``http://{bridgeIP}/hue`` and enter the IP of your genuine bridge.
You can find the IP of your genuine bridge in the Hue app.
Before clicking "Save" press the link button on your genuine Hue Bridge.
The total number of lights copied to Bridge Emulator will be displayed.
These lights will now be available in the app to add to a room.
Note: Room configuration is not imported from the genuine Hue Bridge, only the lights.
