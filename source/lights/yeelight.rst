YeeLight
########

Yeelight bulbs are automatically discovered and added to hue emulator on light search performed from Hue app. The light must be first connected to local wifi network and the LAN control must be enabled from YeeLight app (is done from eject icon located in bottom right corner). If light ip address will be changed you need to perform new light search in order to update the ip addresses for all the lights.
